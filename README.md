Redux, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, and Clean Architecture for Networking.

**UI Frameworks**
- **SwiftUI and UIKit are used together to leverage their strengths:**
- SwiftUI: A modern, declarative syntax framework by Apple. It represents the future of UI development on iOS, focusing on simplicity and declarative programming.
- UIKit: Still widely used for navigation and other legacy components, as it offers mature and robust features not yet fully replicated in SwiftUI.

**Combine Framework**
- Combine provides a declarative API for handling asynchronous events and processing values over time.

**Redux in SwiftUI**
- The Redux pattern is seamlessly integrated into SwiftUI for state management:
- Redux’s unidirectional data flow philosophy aligns perfectly with SwiftUI’s declarative nature.
- In this approach, views are driven by state, and updates occur only when the state changes.
- SwiftUI’s internal mechanisms resemble a reducer pattern, making Redux an excellent choice for managing state in iOS apps.
